# Teaching and Course Materials

A brief description of what this project does and its purpose. 

## Table of Contents

- [Numerical Analysis](#numerical-analysis)
- [Differential Equations](#differential-equations)
- [Mathematical Modeling](#mathematical-modeling)
- [Computational Neuroscience](#computational-neuroscience)
- [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra)
- [Multivariate Calculus](#multivariate-calculus)

## Numerical Analysis

Key things to mention:
- Juypter notebook for lecture (embed? if possible, otherwise screenshot)
- Project samples (link Kevin spatial modeling potentially)
- Explain that course assessment materials won't be posted publicly

## Differential Equations

- old demonstrations?
- discuss pplane dfield usage
- samples of old assignments (if can find)

## Mathematical Modeling

- explain independent study
- showcase a project
- sample of old assignment or two

## Computational Neuroscience

- simple hodgkin-huxley code
- old videos if can be found
- lecture slides (?)
- example assignment

## Linear Algebra

- showcase projects (markov chain, traffic flow, etc.)
- include student project (john (?))
- coding samples from old linear algebra (SVD for image comp, catmap, etc.)

## Multivariate Calculus

- possibly cut, include regression project maybe 


# Research Mentoring Materials

This will go in its own branch

## master's student

Discuss Luke's project and his contributions

## undergraduate student

Discuss Zihan's project, include video, etc.
