# Teaching and Course Materials

This repository provides a sample of teaching materials used during my time in academia. The examples are a mixture of applied mathematics projects that I have assigned, projeection submission from students, and code I have used for demonstrations.

### Numerical Analysis

Key things to mention:
- Juypter notebook for lecture (embed? if possible, otherwise screenshot)
- Project samples (link Kevin spatial modeling potentially)
- Explain that course assessment materials won't be posted publicly

### Linear Algebra

Another course I have taught while at the College of Charleston is Linear Algebra. This is a sophomore-level course that was taken by students planning to major in most STEM fields with some small exceptions. Students in my course primarily consisted of engineering, physics, data science, and mathematics students. As a result, the course focused on theory and techniques, but I included an optional coding component. The course followed a standard lecture and exam format with the additional of worksheet and project components. During lecture, I wrote snippets of code in MATLAB to demonstrate examples given in-class. An early lecture slide is viewable [here](linear_algebra_lecture02-gauss.pdf). 

The worksheets were assigned every few weeks. The worksheets were typically applications of lecture topics or additional topics students may not commonly see. For example, the first worksheet [here](viewable linear_algebra_worksheet1.pdf) focused on applications of linear systems. This included traffic modeling, spline interpolation, and transformation of an exponential function. The last worksheet (viewable [here](linear_algebra_worksheet5.pdf)) provided a simple calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, discussed the derivation of the power method to approximate the largest eigenvalue.

The project (rubric viewable [here](linear_algebra_project_rubric.pdf)) was an assessment given at the end of the semester for students to utilize what they had learned during the course. The students were tasked with finding one (or more) peer-reviewed journals that used methods discussed in-class. The students were then asked to summarize the results and discuss how the methods from class were used to address questions within the paper. For ambitious students, I included a bonus to write their project in LaTeX. 

### Mathematical Modeling

Previously, I ran an independent study for a mathematics and biology undergraduate who was interested in applying techniques learned from previous classes to biological models (syllabus here). The student and I met approximately once a week to discuss relevant chapters from the assigned reading, discuss questions from previous homework and projects, or to address any coding errors. The course consisted of understanding dynamics and introductory stochastic processes. Homework (example here) and projects (example here) were written based on the topics covered but framed using biological models from literature. The student has since moved on to a PhD program at UC Davis.
