# Teaching and Course Materials

This repository provides a sample of teaching materials used during my time in academia. The examples are a mixture of applied mathematics projects that I have assigned, projeection submission from students, and code I have used for demonstrations.

## Quick Links

### College of Charleston

- [Numerical Analysis](#numerical-analysis)
- [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra)
- [Mathematical Modeling](#mathematical-modeling)
- [Calculus](#introductory-and-multivariate-calculus)

### Northwestern University

- [Computational Neuroscience](#computational-neuroscience)
- [Differential Equations](#differential-equations)

### Potential Student Projects

- Maybe include this, cover search strategy ideas with video
- Inhibitory synapse inclusion into neuron model
- death/decay separation for roots

## College of Charleston

### Numerical Analysis

Key things to mention:
- Juypter notebook for lecture (embed? if possible, otherwise screenshot)
- Project samples (link Kevin spatial modeling potentially)
- Explain that course assessment materials won't be posted publicly

### Linear Algebra

- showcase projects (markov chain, traffic flow, etc.)
- include student project (john (?))
- coding samples from old linear algebra (SVD for image comp, catmap, etc.)

### Mathematical Modeling

- explain independent study
- showcase a project
- sample of old assignment or two


## Northwestern University

### Computational Neuroscience

- simple hodgkin-huxley code
- old videos if can be found
- lecture slides (?)
- example assignment

### Differential Equations

- old demonstrations?
- discuss pplane dfield usage
- samples of old assignments (if can find)


### Introductory and Multivariate Calculus

- possibly cut, include regression project maybe 


## Research Mentoring Materials

This will go in its own branch

## master's student

Discuss Luke's project and his contributions

## undergraduate student

Discuss Zihan's project, include video, etc.
